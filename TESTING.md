## Testing

### Manual Testing

The project was built using Google Chrome and tested through Chrome Developer Tools. All elements were tested with Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari (from my personal device). I have not tested the features using Internet Explorer, as support ended for this browser on some operating systems in June 2022.
